          <p><strong>IMAGINARY</strong> creates and distributes interactive exhibits that communicate modern mathematics to the general
            public. As a non profit organization we promote mathematical education and knowledge worldwide by offering
            all content as open source on our website imaginary.org. We empower people to organize local
            exhibitions and carry modern mathematics to every corner on earth.</p>
          <p>Our philosophy and international network of math enthusiasts help us to constantly develop our content,
            to produce new exhibits and to establish <strong>IMAGINARY</strong> as think tank for modern mathematics communication.</p>
          <p>Started as project at the Mathematische Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach in 2008 and spun-off in 2016
            with support of the Leibniz Association, we have inspired millions of visitors in more than 50 countries
            with our exhibits ever since.</p>
